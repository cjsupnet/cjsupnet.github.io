        <p class="center-aligned-description">I currently work within a 2-person Design Team to revamp Replicon's visual design. Our work includes designing webpages and creating web banners, infographics, email templates, ebooks, slide decks, and print collateral (brochures, case studies, white papers, datasheets). We operate within the Marketing Team but we collaborate closely with the Webteam (based in Bangalore), oftentimes helping them update content on Replicon's WordPress-hosted website.</p>
