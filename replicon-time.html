        <p class="center-aligned-description">I currently work within a 2-person Design Team to revamp Replicon's visual design. Our work includes designing webpages and creating web banners, infographics, ebooks, slide decks, and print collateral (brochures, case studies, white papers, datasheets). We operate within the Marketing Team but we collaborate closely with the Web Team (based in Bangalore), oftentimes helping them update content on Replicon's WordPress-hosted website.  I have also had the opportunity to work alongside the Product Team to create illustrations for Replicon's mobile app and crew timesheet feature. Check out some creative pieces below.</p>
